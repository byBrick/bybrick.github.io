Welcome to our new blog! This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). To quote the start page:

> This is our technical blog where we write about code, share open source projects or discuss solutions to problems we encounter in our daily workplace here at byBrick.

We’re very excited to have you here and hope that you’ll be back as we fill this space with interesting articles.
